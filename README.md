# Basic Rendering and Transformations - The Sun, Earth and Moon :moon: 

By Richard Taylor (TYLRIC007)

Hi, Welcome to my assignment 1. To set up, all you need to do is run (for Windows):

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

For the requirements, and 

```
> py src/main.py
```

to run the main file. Once the program is running, press ***SPACE*** to begin the animation. ***SPACE*** can then be used to pause and play the animation. Additionally, the ***UP ARROW*** and ***DOWN ARROW*** can be used to speed up and slow down the orbit of the Earth respectivley, and you can do likewise with the ***LEFT ARROW*** and the ***RIGHT ARROW*** for the orbit of the Moon.

You can also quit anytime by pressing ***Q***.

Thank you :smile:
