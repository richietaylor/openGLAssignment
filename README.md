Hi, Welcome to my assignment 1. To set up, all you need to do is run (for Windows):

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

For the requirements, and 

```
py src/main.py
```


## Controls

- ***Space***: Start stop animation (the moving light will not stop so you can see it better in action)
- ***Q***: Quit
- ***WASD***: Rotate up, down, left and right around the target planet
- ***TAB***: Switch target planet
- ***Left and Right arrows***: Zoom in and out of the scene
- ***K***: Speed up Moon orbit speed
- ***M***: Slow down Moon orbit speed
- ***J***: Speed up Earth orbit speed
- ***N***: Slow down Earth orbit speed


Thank you :smile:
