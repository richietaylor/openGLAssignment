PyOpenGL Skeleton Code

Setup assumes that you are using a UNIX-based OS with python3 and python3-venv installed.

To build the virtual environment and install necessary packages:

```
> make
```

Note: You can also put any packages you want to use in the requirements.txt file.

To activate the virtual environment:

```
> source ./venv/bin/activate
```

To run the skeleton code:

```
> python ./src/main.py
```

You should see the following output (once you've implemented the Window rendering):
